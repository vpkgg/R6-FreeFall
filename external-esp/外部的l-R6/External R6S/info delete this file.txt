Info: Source (Does Not Include A Bypass) Soo there will be errors. Basic Visuals such as, Corner/Box, Filled Box, Healthbar. All Offsets And Sigs are updated to latest patch aka Halloween Update. Source was made for new people to review and understand how things work. Myself is very new to the game engine so hope this helps some people. Code is not perfect and can always be changed, feel free to send a pull request :) Shoutout to all the people contributing in the r6 thread.
